<p>
 My name is Ashar Durrani.
 I work as a QA Analyst at MIMO, LLC in Chicago, Illinois.
I have been enrolled at FullStack Acadamy for the 2022 Web Developmet Cohort.
My goal is to excell my knowledge and become a professional Web Developer after successfully completing this course.
I think FullStack Academy is a great place to learn and accomplish my goal, so far I have had a great experience in this cohort.</p>
